# React Hooks

React Hooks are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow functional components to use features like state, lifecycle methods, and context, which were previously only available in class components.

They make it easier to write clean, reusable, and maintainable code without converting functions into class components.

### Examples

- `useState` for adding state to a component.
- `useEffect` for handling side effects like, API calls.
- `useContext` for accessing global values.
- `useRef`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` for advanced use cases and performance optimization.

## Why were hooks introduced?

Hooks were introduced because there were some issues in class components like,

- Complex and hard-to-manage lifecycle logic
- It was hard to reuse logic that uses state in different components.
- Verbose and less readable code.

> With hooks, functional components become powerful and we can easily handle side effects, state and more with simpler syntax.
