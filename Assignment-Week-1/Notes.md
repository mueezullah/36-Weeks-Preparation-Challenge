# JavaScript Core Concepts for Beginners

A professional yet beginner-friendly overview of important JavaScript concepts with analogies, examples, and explanations.

## 📘 Interpreted vs Compiled Languages

- **Compiled languages** (like C, C++) are translated into machine code _before_ running. Think of it like baking a cake — you need all ingredients and steps ready before you can enjoy it.
- **Interpreted languages** (like JavaScript) are translated _line by line_ while the program runs. Like a chef reading and cooking from the recipe at the same time.

## ⚖️ Why JavaScript > Other Languages?

- JavaScript runs in every browser, making it perfect for web development. It's the only language natively understood by browsers.
- It's super versatile — you can build frontend (with React), backend (with Node.js), mobile apps, and more.
- Massive community support and tons of libraries/tools make development faster and smoother.

---

## 🧾 Strict vs Dynamic Languages

- **Strictly typed languages** (like Java) require you to define variable types (e.g., int x = 5).
- **Dynamically typed languages** (like JavaScript) figure out the type automatically: `let x = 5;` could later be `x = "hello"`.
- Analogy: Strict typing is like fixed job roles, dynamic typing is like multitasking without a defined job title.

## 🧵 Single-Threaded Nature of JavaScript

- JavaScript executes one command at a time in a single sequence — it's like a cashier at a single-counter shop handling one customer at a time.
- This can make things slow unless we use **async features** like callbacks, promises, and async/await.

---

## 🧠 Functions

- A function is a reusable block of code that does a task. Think of it as a machine: you give input (parameters), it gives output (return value).

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice
```

- Above, `greet` is a function that takes a `name` and returns a greeting.

---

## 🔁 Callback Functions

- A **callback function** is a function passed into another function to run later.
- Analogy: Booking a cab and giving your number — the cab driver will _call back_ when they arrive.

```js
function processUserInput(callback) {
  const name = "Bob";
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(function (name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
});
```

## 🔍 Difference Between `map()` and `filter()`

- **`map()`** transforms each item in an array.
- **`filter()`** selects items that meet a condition.

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = nums.map((n) => n * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
const even = nums.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
```

---

## 🏗️ Classes

- A class is a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods.
- Analogy: A class is like a car blueprint; you can build many car objects from it.

```js
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }

  honk() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} goes beep!`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Toyota");
myCar.honk(); // Toyota goes beep!
```

---

## 🧱 Objects

- Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
- Analogy: An object is like a contact — name, number, address — grouped together.

```js
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true,
};
console.log(user.name); // Alice
```

## 🔄 6 Loops in JavaScript

1. `for` loop
2. `while` loop
3. `do...while` loop
4. `for...of` loop
5. `for...in` loop
6. `Array.forEach()`

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

// for
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) console.log(arr[i]);

// while
let i = 0;
while (i < arr.length) console.log(arr[i++]);

// do...while
let j = 0;
do {
  console.log(arr[j]);
  j++;
} while (j < arr.length);

// for...of
for (let val of arr) console.log(val);

// for...in (better for objects)
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
for (let key in obj) console.log(key, obj[key]);

// forEach
arr.forEach((val) => console.log(val));
```

## ⏳ Async vs Await

- `async` makes a function return a promise.
- `await` pauses the function until the promise resolves.
- Analogy: Ordering food and waiting at the counter (await) vs ordering and continuing your day (normal async).

```js
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com");
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
```

---

## 🧵 Promises

- A Promise represents a value that might be available now, later, or never.
- It has 3 states: **Pending**, **Fulfilled**, **Rejected**.

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const success = true;
  if (success) resolve("Done!");
  else reject("Failed!");
});

promise.then((res) => console.log(res)).catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

- Analogy: Promise is like ordering something online — it may arrive (resolve) or get canceled (reject).
