# üîê Authentication & Authorization

---

## üîê What is Authentication?

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the person or entity accessing the system is who they claim to be.

### How Authentication Works:

1. User submits their credentials (like a **username** and **password**).
2. The server checks these credentials against a stored record (usually in a database).
3. If the credentials match, the user is authenticated and granted access.

> Example: Logging in to a website by entering a username and password.

## ‚úÖ What is Authorization?

**Authorization** is the process of determining what a **verified (authenticated)** user can and cannot do within a system. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

### How Authorization Works:

1. Once the user is authenticated, the system checks their permissions or roles.
2. Based on their role or permissions, the system grants or restricts access to specific resources.

> Example: An admin user can access the user management panel, but a regular user cannot.
