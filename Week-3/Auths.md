# üîê Authentication & Authorization

---

## üîê What is Authentication?

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the person or entity accessing the system is who they claim to be.

### How Authentication Works:

1. User submits their credentials (like a **username** and **password**).
2. The server checks these credentials against a stored record (usually in a database).
3. If the credentials match, the user is authenticated and granted access.

> Example: Logging in to a website by entering a username and password.

## ‚úÖ What is Authorization?

**Authorization** is the process of determining what a **verified (authenticated)** user can and cannot do within a system. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

### How Authorization Works:

1. Once the user is authenticated, the system checks their permissions or roles.
2. Based on their role or permissions, the system grants or restricts access to specific resources.

> Example: An admin user can access the user management panel, but a regular user cannot.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Difference Between Authentication and Authorization

| **Aspect**         | **Authentication**                     | **Authorization**                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Verifying the identity of a user.      | Determining the permissions or access level of the user. |
| **What it checks** | "Who are you?" (Identity)              | "What are you allowed to do?" (Permissions)              |
| **Example**        | Logging in with username and password. | Accessing different pages based on user roles.           |
| **Process**        | Happens first, before authorization.   | Happens after successful authentication.                 |
| **Goal**           | Confirm the user's identity.           | Control access to resources or actions.                  |

# üîê Authentication vs Authorization - Interview Q&A

This README contains commonly asked **interview questions and answers** related to **Authentication** and **Authorization**, essential concepts in web development and application security.

## ‚úÖ Authentication

### Q1. What is authentication?

**Answer**: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the person trying to access the system is who they claim to be (e.g., via login credentials like username/password, OTP, biometrics).

### Q2. What are the common methods of authentication?

**Answer**:

- Password-based login
- OTP (One-Time Password)
- Biometric authentication
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT)
- OAuth (for third-party login via Google, GitHub, etc.)

### Q3. What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

**Answer**: MFA requires users to verify their identity using more than one method of authentication, typically:

1. Something you know (password)
2. Something you have (phone, OTP)
3. Something you are (fingerprint, face scan)

### Q4. What is token-based authentication?

**Answer**: It uses a token (like a JWT) generated by the server after login and sent back with future requests to verify the user‚Äôs identity.

### Q5. How is authentication typically implemented in modern web apps?

**Answer**:

- Client sends login credentials to server.
- Server verifies and generates a session or token (e.g., JWT).
- Token is sent with each request (usually in the header).
- Server verifies token before granting access.

## üõ°Ô∏è Authorization

### Q1. What is authorization?

**Answer**: Authorization is the process of verifying **what actions** an authenticated user is allowed to perform. It determines access levels and permissions.

### Q2. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

**Answer**:

| Feature       | Authentication                 | Authorization                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Purpose       | Verifies identity              | Verifies access level                |
| Happens when? | First, before authorization    | After authentication                 |
| Example       | Login with username & password | Access admin panel, delete resources |
| Outcome       | Logged in or not               | Access granted or denied             |

### Q3. How is authorization implemented?

**Answer**:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- ACL (Access Control List)
- Permissions set on API routes, UI elements, or resources.

### Q4. What are roles and permissions?

**Answer**:

- **Role**: A category like "admin", "editor", or "user".
- **Permission**: What actions that role can perform, e.g., "edit post", "delete comment".

## üîÅ Combined Example

**Scenario**: A user logs in to a blogging platform.

- **Authentication**: The system verifies the user‚Äôs credentials.
- **Authorization**: The system checks whether the user can edit, delete, or view certain blog posts based on their role (e.g., only admins can delete).

---

## üìò Common Interview Follow-up Questions

### Q1. What is the difference between session-based and token-based authentication?

**Answer**:

- **Session-based**: Server stores session on login, and client sends session ID with each request (stored in cookies).
- **Token-based**: Server issues a token (like JWT) that the client stores (e.g., in localStorage) and sends with each request.

### Q2. Where should JWT tokens be stored: cookies or localStorage?

**Answer**:

- **Cookies**: Safer if HTTP-only and Secure flags are set.
- **localStorage**: Easier to use, but vulnerable to XSS attacks. Not ideal for sensitive data.

### Q3. What are some risks in poor authentication systems?

**Answer**:

- Credential stuffing
- Brute-force attacks
- Token theft
- Session hijacking

## üîí Best Practices

- Always hash and salt passwords.
- Use HTTPS to prevent token interception.
- Implement rate limiting for login routes.
- Use strong secrets/keys to sign JWTs.
- Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage.
