## ❓ What is React and Why Did React Come?

**React** is a JavaScript library for building **user interfaces**, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. It was developed by **Facebook** and released in 2013.

### 🚀 Why React Was Created:

- **Complex UIs:** As web apps grew in size, managing UI updates became difficult with just vanilla JavaScript.
- **Code Reusability:** React introduced **components**, making it easier to reuse pieces of UI.
- **Efficient Updates:** React uses a **virtual DOM** to update only the parts of the page that need changes, improving performance.
- **Separation of Concerns:** React encourages organizing logic, UI, and state in a clear, maintainable way.

## 🔍 Comparison: React Problem Solving vs JavaScript Problem Solving

| Feature              | Vanilla JavaScript                                | React                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **DOM Manipulation** | Manual (using `document.querySelector`, etc.)     | Handled by React with Virtual DOM                            |
| **Code Reusability** | Requires writing functions and templates manually | Uses reusable Components                                     |
| **UI Updates**       | Tedious and error-prone                           | Declarative and efficient                                    |
| **State Management** | Handled via global variables or libraries         | Handled with `useState`, `useReducer`, or external libraries |
| **Performance**      | Slower for complex UIs due to full DOM re-renders | Faster with Virtual DOM diffing                              |

> 💡 In short: React abstracts a lot of the low-level DOM operations so developers can focus on building features.

## ⚙️ Core Concepts in React

### 🧩 1. Components

A **Component** is a building block in React. It’s a JavaScript function or class that returns JSX (HTML-like code). Components can be reused and composed together.

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

There are two types:

- **Functional Components** (with Hooks)
- **Class Components** (older approach)

---

### 📦 2. State

State is an object that holds **dynamic data** (it can hold static data but it is not recommended) in a component. When state changes, the component re-renders to reflect those changes.

```js
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### 🔁 3. Re-rendering

React **automatically re-renders** a component when:

- Its state changes via `useState`, `useReducer`, etc.
- Its props (input data from a parent component) change.

During re-rendering, React efficiently updates only the parts of the UI that changed, using its Virtual DOM to minimize performance impact.

# 🎯 Key Interview Questions

---

### 1. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It helps build reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.

---

### 2. Why use React instead of plain JavaScript?

React provides a better way to manage dynamic UIs using components, state, and the virtual DOM. It reduces manual DOM manipulation and increases maintainability and performance.

---

### 3. Why React over other libraries or frameworks like Vue or Angular?

- **Lightweight & Flexible**: React is more flexible than Angular and doesn’t enforce strict patterns.

- **Large Community & Ecosystem**: It has vast support, resources, and third-party tools.

- **Reusable Components & Hooks**: React offers a simple and powerful way to reuse logic with hooks.

- **Learning Curve**: Easier to start with compared to Angular.

- **JSX**: Writing HTML-like code in JavaScript improves developer experience.

📌 The choice often depends on the project needs, but React is favored for its **performance**, **simplicity**, and **popularity**.

---

### 4. What is the difference between State and Props?

- State is internal data managed by a component using `useState`.

- Props are external inputs passed from a parent component to a child.

---

### 5. What triggers a re-render in React?

A re-render happens when a component’s state or props change.

---

### 6. What is the Virtual DOM?

It’s a lightweight copy of the actual DOM used by React to track changes and update only what's necessary. It improves performance.
